                We’re depositing any projects that the Oxford community brings to us. Some will work, some may not, but let’s bring it all to the table.
                <br /><br />
                OxCAN is always looking to find greenspaces that can be reached by our existing infrastructure, because why reinvent the wheel? That existing infrastructure can then be extended by greenways.
                <br /><br />
                Greenways only work if they connect and network destinations. We are looking in town for pedestrian paths that are already worn in, based on the need to walk or bike to a destination. As we find these pathways, we are preparing high level plans that can be presented to the decision-makers in Oxford.
                <br /><br />
                These concepts come from you. If you see a need, <MudLink Href="mailto:info@oxfordcan.org">let us know</MudLink>.
