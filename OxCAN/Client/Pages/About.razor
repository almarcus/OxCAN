                We’re about making sure that things happen. That’s the simple mission- if your Oxford Community needs action, we want our network of like-minded citizens to help you out. We want our town to be connected. Right now that means it’s about greenspaces and the greenways to get us there, but we want our network of volunteers to be able to help our City get it done.
                <br /><br />
                If you can offer your time and talent to help the City achieve their goals in providing a walkable, friendly town- then we want you to be a part of what we are doing.
                <br /><br />
                Oxford C.A.N., because Oxford can.
